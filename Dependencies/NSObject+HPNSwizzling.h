 * If the original selector does not exist in the class, will try to add the
 * implementation to the class using the typesSelector if it is not NULL. On
 * success, *store is set to NULL, *didAddPtr is set to YES.
 *
 * About fixChildrenSwizzling:
 *    * Let say you swizzle UIButton's setBackgroundColor: method. UIButton does
 *      not have an implementation of setBackgroundColor: of its own (up to my
 *      knowing; anyway let's say it does not). Thus, an implementation of the
 *      selector will be added to UIButton, and the store will be set to the
 *      original implementation of UIView's setBackgroundColor: (first superview
 *      to implement it).
 *    * Then, let say you swizzle UIView's setBackgroundColor:. It will work; no
 *      problem.
 *    * Now, let's call setBackgroundColor: on an instance of UIButton. As you
 *      know a thing or two about swizzling, you call the original
 *      implementation of setBackgroundColor: in your custom implementation. As
 *      you swizzled UIView's implementation of the selector, you would expect
 *      to be called in your custom implementation of UIView's
 *      setBackgroundColor:. But you won't: as the method was not swizzled when
 *      you swizzled UIButton, the actual original implementation of UIView will
 *      be called.
 *    * fixChildrenSwizzling, if set to YES will fix this problem for you: Each
 *      time a selector is swizzled, the store will be kept along with the class
 *      on which the swizzling was made. When a superclass swizzles a method a
 *      child swizzled, the store of the child will be updated to point to the
 *      new original implementation.
 *      This also works if there was no original implementation (store set to
 *      NULL) and a superclass adds one.
 *
 * Note: If store is non-NULL, it must always point to a valid memory location
 *       while the application is launched (unless you don't plan on fixing
 *       children swizzling).
 *       It is highly recommended that you keep a reference to the original
 *       implementation of the method using the store variable: when you swizzle
 *       a method, you practically always have to call the original method.
 *       (Giving a NULL store will print a warning in the logs.)
